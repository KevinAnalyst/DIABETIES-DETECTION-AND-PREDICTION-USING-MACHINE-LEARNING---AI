# DIABETIES-DETECTION-AND-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING---AI

DIABETIES DETECTION AND PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING & AI
Machine learning and AI as become center point in solving health related problems like diabetes detection and prediction. The disease has affected many people across the global. This is resulted by increase in blood sugar level due to insulin imbalanced processed by the body. Every time the problem occurs doctors are consulted which is time wastage.
The Main purpose of the task is to come up with solution for early detection by use of different classification algorithm and adopt the suitable in terms of its accuracy. The project will utilize supervised algorithm include;
•	Logistic regression
•	Random forest classifier
•	Decision tree classifier
Before starting of modeling, the procedure will be guided by the steps below;
•	Data understanding
•	Data preparation
•	Data modeling
•	Model evaluation
•	Deployment for production
After modeling and evaluation by utilizing the Logistic Regression, decision tree and random forest algorithm, it was established accuracy on train & test was (0.7523,0.759259),(1.0,0.6481),(1.0,0.7962) respectively.
The best algorithm to be used in DIABETIES DETECTION AND PREDICTION on the dataset is Logistic regression because of 75% on both train and test where new data will generalize well due to exclusion of over fitting

Finally the model was deployed for production; it can be access by clicking the link here
